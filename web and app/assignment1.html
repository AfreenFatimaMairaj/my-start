<p><b>atom,</b> the basic building of all matters and chemistry.Atoms can combine with other atoms to form molicules but cannotbe 
        divide into smaller parts by ordinary chemical process</p>
<h2>subatmic particles</h2>
<p> Most of the atoms is empty space.The rest consists of three basic types of subatomic particles:
     electrons,protons, and neutrons</p>
<h2>neucles</h2>
<p>the protons and neutrons from the atom <sub>,</sub>s central neucles( The ordinary hydrogen atom is an expectation;
    it contains one proton but no neutron)</p>
<h3>proton</h3>
<p>proton have a electrical positive charge</p>
<h3>neutron</h3>
<p>neutron are electrically neutral.They carry no charge</p>
<h3>electrons</h3>
<p>circling the neules is a cloud of electrons ,which are negatively charge</p>
<p>An ordinary ,neutral atom has equal number of protons(in the neucles)and electrons (surroudig the neucles ).Thus the positive and 
    negative charge are blanced</p>
    <h2>ions</h2>
    <p>some atoms,  however lose or gains electrons in chemical reactions or in collisions with other particles .Ordinary atoms 
        that either gain or lose electrons are called <q>Ions</q></p>
        <h3>positive Ions </h3>
        <p>If a neutral atom loses a electron,it becomes a positive ion</p>
        <h3>Negative Ions</h3>
        <P>If a gains a electorn,it becomes a negative ions</P>
        <p>More than 90 types  of atoms exist in nature,and each kind of atom form a different <b>Chemical Element.</b>Chemical element 
             are made up of only one type of atom <q>gold contains only gold atoms,</q>and<q>neon cotais only neon atoms</q>and they
              are ranked in order of their atomic mumber in a chart called <b>The Periodic Table</b></p>
<h2>Atomic Number</h2><p>The single most important characteristic of an atom ,is its atomic number(usually denoted by the letter Z),
    which is defined as a number of units of positive charge (proton)in neucles.For example,if an atom has a Z of 6,it is carbon
    ,while a Z of 92 coprresponds to uranium </p>
    <h2>Atomic Mass</h2><p>It is usual to characterize different isotops by giving the sums of the number of protons and neutreos
         the neucles ,a quantity called <q>The Atomic Mass Number</q>.In the above example,the first atom would be called carbon-12 or
          C <sup>12</sup>(because it has six protons and six neutrons) </p>
